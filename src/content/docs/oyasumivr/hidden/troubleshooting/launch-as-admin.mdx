If you run into this issue, you most likely tried to run OyasumiVR as administrator.

For security reasons, OyasumiVR does **not** support being ran with administrative privileges. 
As various features in OyasumiVR can be configured to run other applications on your behalf, 
running OyasumiVR as administrator could pose a security risk, and offer malicious actors a path to privilege escalation.

While some of OyasumiVR's features do require administrative privileges (for example, those for limiting power usage of your graphics card), 
these are safely controlled through a separate elevated sidecar process, allowing OyasumiVR itself to run with standard user privileges.

### I know what I'm doing and I want to do it anyways

:::caution
Running OyasumiVR's main process with administrative privileges could pose security risks.
Please **do not try this** unless you're willing to accept these risks.
:::

It is possible to have OyasumiVR disable its elevation security. To disable elevation security:

1. Open a command prompt with administrative privileges. An easy way to do this is to press `Win+X` and select `Terminal (Admin)`.

2. Change to the installation directory, containing the `OyasumiVR.exe` file.	(The installation path may differ, adjust it accordingly)
```powershell title="Command Prompt (Admin)"
$ cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\OyasumiVR"
```

3. Run OyasumiVR with the following flag:
```powershell title="Command Prompt (Admin)"
$ .\OyasumiVR.exe --dont-need-security-where-im-going-uwu
```

You can now close the command prompt. You should only have to do this once. 
If everything went correctly, from now on you should now be able to run OyasumiVR with administrative privileges. 

#### Resetting elevation security

In order to reset elevation security, you can follow the same steps, but use the following flag instead:

```powershell title="Command Prompt (Admin)"
$ .\OyasumiVR.exe --reset-elevation-security
```

OyasumiVR will now no longer allow you to run it with administrative privileges.

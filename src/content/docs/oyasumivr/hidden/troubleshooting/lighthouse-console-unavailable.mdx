If you run into this issue, it means OyasumiVR was unable to access the Lighthouse Console. 
The lighthouse console is a tool included with SteamVR, that allows OyasumiVR to interact with lighthouse based controllers and trackers.

### Non-default SteamVR installations

By default, OyasumiVR will attempt to find the lighthouse console in the default SteamVR installation location.
If you have installed SteamVR to a non-default location, you must specify the path to the lighthouse console manually.

You can configure the path of your lighthouse console by going to the **Settings** -> **General Settings**, and scrolling down to the **Lighthouse Console** section.

The usual location for the lighthouse console is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR\tools\lighthouse\bin\win64\lighthouse_console.exe`.

If you have installed SteamVR to a Steam library other than the default one, you will most likely find it at `<YOUR_STEAM_LIBRARY>\steamapps\common\SteamVR\tools\lighthouse\bin\win64\lighthouse_console.exe`.

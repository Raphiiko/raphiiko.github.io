In order to enable external programs to interact with your Treadmill, VRTI offers a websocket API that the user can enable.

:::note
The Websocket API is only available with a paid license.
:::

## Configuration

The Websocket API can be enabled within VRTI's settings.

By default, the websocket API is exposed on port `54126`. This port can be changed by the user within the settings dialog.

:::caution
VRTI's websocket API only listens on `127.0.0.1` (localhost). You cannot connect to VRTI over the network from another device.

## Message Formats

### Command Format

Commands are sent to VRTI to perform various actions.
Every command should be a JSON object with the following properties:

| Property                                                  | Value Type | Description                                                                                                    |
|:----------------------------------------------------------|:-----------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `command`                                                 | string     | The command to run                                                                                             |
| <span style="white-space: nowrap">`payload` **\***</span> | string     | The command specific payload for the specified command. This should always be a valid JSON value.              |
| <span style="white-space: nowrap">`refId` **\***</span>   | string     | A unique identifier for the command. This identifier will be returned in any response event if you specify it. |
| <span style="white-space: nowrap">**\*** Optional</span>  |

See the [Command Reference](/vrti/developer/websocket-api/command-reference) for a list of available commands.

Some commands will return a response, which will be sent like any other [event](#event-format).
Unlike other events, clients do not have to subscribe to these response events to receive them.

### Event Format

Events are sent by VRTI to connected clients.

Event messages are only sent for the specific events that the client has subscribed to.
For events that are sent as a response to a command, clients do not have to subscribe to receive them.

To subscribe to an event, send a [`EventSubscribe`](/vrti/developer/websocket-api/command-reference/#eventsubscribe) command for each event you want to receive messages for.

Every event is a JSON object with the following properties:

| Property                                                  | Value Type | Description                                                                                                                         |
|:----------------------------------------------------------|:-----------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `event`                                                   | string     | The name of the event                                                                                                               |
| <span style="white-space: nowrap">`payload` **\***</span> | string     | The event specific payload for the specified event. This is always a valid JSON value.                                              |
| <span style="white-space: nowrap">`refId` **\***</span>   | string     | If this event is a response to a command for which a `refId` property was specified, this property will be set with the same value. |
| <span style="white-space: nowrap">**\*** Optional</span>  |

See the [Event Reference](/vrti/developer/websocket-api/event-reference) for a list of available events.

## Connecting to the WebSocket

A TypeScript example of how to connect to the WebSocket API in NodeJS is shown below.

While these examples are written in TypeScript, you can apply the same concepts to any other languages that support WebSockets.

```typescript
// Construct the WebSocket object and connect to VRTI's WebSocket.
const socket = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:54126");

socket.addEventListener("open", (event) => {
  // We are now connected to VRTI's WebSocket API
  console.log("Connected to VRTI");
});
```

## Sending a command

Once you are connected to VRTI's WebSocket, you can send commands to VRTI to perform various actions.

Below you will find an example of how to send a command that starts a treadmill by setting its target speed to 5.0 km/h.

```typescript
// Construct the message for the command
const message = {
  command: "SetTargetSpeed",
  payload: "5.0"
};
// Convert the message to a JSON string and send it over the WebSocket
socket.send(JSON.stringify(message));
```

See the [Command Reference](/vrti/developer/websocket-api/command-reference) for a full list of available commands.

## Subscribing to events

To receive events from VRTI, you need to subscribe to them (with the exception of events sent as a command response).
To subscribe to an event, you need to send the [`EventSubscribe`](/vrti/developer/websocket-api/command-reference/#eventsubscribe) command with the events you want to receive:

```typescript
// Subscribe to the TreadmillStateUpdated and AutoWalkSettingsUpdated events
const message = {
  command: "EventSubscribe",
  payload: JSON.stringify(["TreadmillStateUpdated", "AutoWalkSettingsUpdated"])
};
  socket.send(JSON.stringify(message));
```

See the [Event Reference](/vrti/developer/websocket-api/event-reference) for a full list of available events you can subscribe to.

Once you have subscribed to an event, you will receive messages for that event as they occur:

      if (message.event === 'TreadmillStateUpdated') {

In order to use VRTI, you will need the following:

- A PC running Windows 10 or later with:
  - A Bluetooth adapter supporting BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). Generally, any Bluetooth adapter that supports Bluetooth 5.0 or later should work.
- A [supported](/vrti/help/supported-devices) treadmill with Bluetooth control.
  - Note that a [virtual treadmill driver](/vrti/getting-started/connecting-your-treadmill/#virtual-device-driver) is available for users without a treadmill.
- If you want to use VRTI with VRChat, you will need:
  - OSC (Open Sound Control) [enabled in VRChat](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/osc-overview#enabling-it).
- If you want to use VRTI with other games, you will need:
  - The [ViGEmBus Driver](https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEmBus/releases/tag/v1.22.0) installed on your PC. If you don't have it when activating XInput mode, VRTI will automatically prompt you to install this driver.

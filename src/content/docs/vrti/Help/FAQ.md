### My treadmill is not connecting to VRTI, what can I do?

If you treadmill is not connecting to VRTI, please ensure that:

- Your specific treadmill is a [supported device](/vrti/help/supported-devices).
- Your treadmill is plugged into power, and that its power switch is turned on.
- Your PC's Bluetooth adapter is turned on.
- The [correct driver](/vrti/getting-started/connecting-your-treadmill) for your treadmill is selected in the settings menu.
- Your treadmill is within Bluetooth range of your PC.
- If you are using a desktop PC with built-in Bluetooth functionality:
  - That any external Bluetooth antennas are secured properly, and not obstructed. Attempting to connect without attaching the external antenna is often insufficient.

### Will you support _X_ treadmill?

VRTI currently only supports various KingSmith WalkingPad models.
However, it is planned to receive FTMS support in order to support more treadmills.

Other than that, it is unlikely that VRTI will ever receive support for other treadmills with proprietary vendor-specific protocols.
Please check the current list of [supported devices](/vrti/help/supported-devices) to see if your treadmill is compatible, or what options are available. 

If you believe you have a treadmill that should be supported, but doesn't work, please feel free to [contact me](/vrti/help/support).

### I have multiple treadmills, how do I connect to the right one?

For now, VRTI connects to the first treadmill it finds.

It is adviced that if you have multiple supported treadmills, you only have one powered on at a time.

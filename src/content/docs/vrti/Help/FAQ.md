### My treadmill is not connecting to VRTI, what can I do?

If you treadmill is not connecting to VRTI, please ensure that:

- Your specific treadmill is a [supported device](/vrti/help/supported-devices).
- Your treadmill is plugged into power, and that its power switch is turned on.
- Your PC's Bluetooth adapter is turned on.
- The [correct driver](/vrti/getting-started/connecting-your-treadmill) for your treadmill is selected in the settings
  menu.
- Your treadmill is within Bluetooth range of your PC.
- If you are using a desktop PC with built-in Bluetooth functionality:
    - That any external Bluetooth antennas are secured properly, and not obstructed. Attempting to connect without
      attaching the external antenna is often insufficient.

### Will you support _X_ treadmill?

If you have a KingSmith WalkingPad model, or one that supports FTMS, and it doesn't seem to work with VRTI, feel free to
get in contact and we'll see if we can get it working! 
Outside of those, it is unlikely that VRTI will support other treadmills with vendor specific protocols.

If you believe you have a treadmill that should be supported, but for some reason doesn't work, please feel free
to [contact me](/vrti/help/support).

### I have multiple treadmills, how do I connect to the right one?

For now, VRTI connects to the first treadmill it finds.

It is adviced that if you have multiple supported treadmills, you only have one powered on at a time.

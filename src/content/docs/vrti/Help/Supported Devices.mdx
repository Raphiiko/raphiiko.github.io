## VR Hardware

- VR-only features only support SteamVR. Alternative runtimes are unsupported.

## Treadmills

### KingSmith

#### WalkingPad

For these models, use the <Badge text="KingSmith WalkingPad Driver" variant="tip" />.

- WalkingPad P1 <Badge text="Tested" variant="success" />
- WalkingPad A1 <Badge text="Untested" variant="caution" />
- WalkingPad R1 PRO <Badge text="Unsupported, Work In Progress" variant="danger" />

For these models, use the <Badge text="Generic Bluetooth (FTMS) Driver" variant="tip" />.

- WalkingPad Z1 <Badge text="Unsupported, Work In Progress" variant="danger" />

Note that if you have a WalkingPad model that is not listed here, it could still work with VRTI.
If you have one, please try connecting your treadmill to VRTI and let me know if it works, so I can add it to the list!

:::note
Support for treadmills with FTMS (Fitness Machine Service) is currently being worked on and will appear in a future release.

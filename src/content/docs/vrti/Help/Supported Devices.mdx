## VR Hardware

- VR-only features only support SteamVR. Alternative runtimes are unsupported.
- VRTI only supports the PC version of VRChat: Standalone headsets are unsupported, unless used in PCVR mode.

## Treadmills

Here you'll find a list of treadmill models that are known to work with VRTI.

Be sure to select the recommended driver for your treadmill model in VRTI's settings.

Note that if you have a Bluetooth-enabled treadmill that is not listed here, it could still work with VRTI!
If you have one, please try connecting your treadmill with any of the available driver options, and let me know if it works so I can add it to this list!

### KingSmith

#### WalkingPad

For these models, use the <Badge text="KingSmith WalkingPad Driver" variant="tip" />

- KingSmith WalkingPad P1 <Badge text="Tested" variant="success" />
- KingSmith WalkingPad R1 PRO<span class="text-white">\*</span> <Badge text="Tested" variant="success" />

<span class="text-white">*</span> The R1 Pro is limited to 6km/h when the bar is
not extended. If you set your maximum speed above 6km/h, you need to make sure
you extend the bar for VRTI to function properly.

For these models, use the <Badge text="Generic Bluetooth (FTMS) Driver" variant="tip" />

- KingSmith WalkingPad Z1 <Badge text="Tested" variant="success" />

### UREVO

## Bluetooth Adapters

Many Bluetooth adapters will work with VRTI, but you'll find a list here of the ones that have been tested and confirmed to work with VRTI.
If your adapter isn't listed here, there's a good chance it will still work: Generally it just needs to support Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

- Intel AX200
- ASUS USB-BT500
- MediaTek MT7922
- TP-Link UB500

As with the treadmills: if you have a model that is not listed here, please let me know if it works with VRTI so I can add it to the list!

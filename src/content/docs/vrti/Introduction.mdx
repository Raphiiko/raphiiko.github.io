**With VRTI (VR Treadmill Interface) you can control your Bluetooth-enabled treadmill, and translate its movement into your game.
This enables you to take walks with your friends in VRChat, or exercise in your favourite VR (or even non-VR) games.**

VRTI provides movement input to your game, either over [OSC](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/osc-overview) in the case of VRChat, or by emulating a virtual Xbox controller for other games (XInput).
The speed at which you walk in-game is determined by the speed of your treadmill.

VRTI communicates with your treadmill over Bluetooth (Low Energy). Please check the current list of [supported devices](/vrti/help/supported-devices) to see if your treadmill is compatible.
Currently, VRTI only supports various KingSmith WalkingPad models, but it is planned to receive FTMS support in order to support more treadmills.

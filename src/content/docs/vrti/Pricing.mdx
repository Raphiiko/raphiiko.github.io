VRTI is free to try in its evaluation mode for as long as you'd like.
If you find it useful and would like to continue using it, you can purchase a license for a one-time fee of $8.

While currently the features in the evaluation mode are identical to the ones you get with a paid license, the evaluation mode is only intended for those who wish to try out VRTI before purchasing a license.
If you wish to continue using VRTI after evaluating it, you are asked to purchase a license.
Please be aware that future updates may introduce features that are only available to paid license holders.

VRTI is available in two versions: with a free evaluation license, and with a perpetual paid license.
The evaluation license is free, activated by default, and allows you to evaluate VRTI indefinitely.

While currently the features for both versions are identical, the evaluation license is only intended for those who wish to try out VRTI before purchasing a license.
If you wish to continue using VRTI after evaluating it, you are asked to purchase a license.
Please be aware that future updates may introduce features that are only available to paid license holders.
